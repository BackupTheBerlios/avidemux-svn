<p class="chaphead"><span class="chapnum"><a name="doc_chap1">1.</a></span>Foreword</p>
	<ul>
	<p>This filter family deals with interlaced video.
	</p>
	</ul>
	<p class="chaphead"><span class="chapnum"><a name="doc_chap2">2.</a></span>Interlacing  filters</p>
<p class="secthead"><a name="doc_chap2_sect1">Deinterlace </a></p>
	<ul>
	<p>This filter is a port of Donald Graft smart-deinterlace filter to YV12
	</p>
	<p>It detects if the image is interlaced and blurs the interlaced parts.
	</p>
	<p>This filter takes two parameters :
	<ul>
<li>Motion threshold : The lower this value, the more easily the interlacing will be detected. Too low means a lot of blurring !</li>
	<li>Blend threshold : When the video has been detected as interlaced, the parts that are under this threshold are blurred. It must be smaller than the previous threshold</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	</ul>
	<p class="secthead"><a name="doc_chap2_sect2">Kernel Deint </a></p>
	<ul>
	<p>This filter is a port of Donald Graft kernel deint (avisynth), more stuff <a href="http://www.neuron2.net">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>It is very efficient.
	</p>	
	</ul>
	<p class="secthead"><a name="doc_chap2_sect3">Pal Shift </a></p>
	<ul>
	<p>This filter  takes a field from an image and the other field from the next image.
	</p>
	<p>A lot of movie (and some DVD) are interlaced this way. 
	</p>
	<p>This filter does not do any check, so activate it, preview it, and if you are happy with the result keep it.
	</p>
	</ul>
	<p class="secthead"><a name="doc_chap2_sect4">Pal Smart </a></p>
	<ul>
	<p>This filter is a mix between the two above. 
	</p>
	<p>It evals the current image and the Pal-shifted image, then takes the less interlaced one and smart deinterlace it. Since chroma is not taken into account, it can lead to small chroma error.
	</p>
	<p>It is a bit on the slow side, but very efficient when the video is of the good type.
	</p>
	<p>It can be used also as a cheap IVTC, as it will reconstruct the progressive frame, but will keep the video at 30 fps and will not discard duplicates to reach 24 fps.
	</p>
	
	</ul>
	<p class="secthead"><a name="doc_chap2_sect5">Drop </a></p>
	<ul>
	<p>This filter has been written by Ron Reithoffer.
	</p>
	<p>If a field is too different from spatial/temporal neighbours (VHS drop out) it is discarded and replaced by an average value from previous and next frame line.
	</p>
	<p>According to the author, this must be the first filter in the filter chain, and will not work well with very interlaced image.
	</p>
	<p><img src="../image_tuto/dropout.jpg">
	</p>
	</ul>
	<p class="secthead"><a name="doc_chap2_sect6">IVTC : HIDDEN </a></p>
	<ul>
	<p>In some case, to convert a movie (24 fps) to NTSC (30 fps), a telecine process is applied. It duplicate fields of frames to add a 5th image.</p>
	<p>  1 2 3 4 =&gt; 1 2 2 3 4 
	</p>
	<p>  1 2 3 4 =&gt; 1 2 3 3 4
	</p>
	<p>
	Whenever possible it is much better to retrieve the original progressive image as it is more suitable to encoding and also easier to encode.	
	</p>
	<p>
	This filter uses a brute force approach to retrieve the original frames. It "counts" the interlacing effects in a image and consider that if two images are the most interlaced AND they follow each other they are candidates.
	</p>
	<p>At the moment, the first image must not be interlaced (check with preview!) else the filter will fail identifying the telecined frames. It is a very immature filter, you have been warned.

	</ul>
	<p class="secthead"><a name="doc_chap2_sect7">Mplayer IVTC </a></p>
	<ul>
	<p>This is a port of Richard Felker IVTC filter, ported from <a href="http://mplayerhq.hu">mplayer</a>.</p>
	<p>It is early job (avidemux and mplayer are a bit different) and you may have from time to time an interlaced frame appearing. Except from that it works very nicely .
	</p>
	</ul>
	<p class="secthead"><a name="doc_chap2_sect8">Pulldown  </a></p>
	<ul>
	<p>This filter converts a 24 fps to a 30 fps video by duplicating fields. Could be handy for DVD driver that hiccups on 24 fps VCD.
	</p>
	</ul>
	<p class="chaphead"><span class="chapnum"><a name="doc_chap3">3.</a></span>Fields related filters</p>
<p class="secthead"><a name="doc_chap3_sect1">Swap fields  </a></p>
	<ul>
	<p>It is very common that capture card/capture software swaps the fields. It will look like a interlacing effect, but on the whole image, not only on moving part</p>
	<p>
	This filter swaps the fields back. Here is a short example, first the image which has swapped fields :
	</p>
	<img src="../images/swap1.png">
	<p>
		And the ouput of the Swap Fields filter :
	</p>
	<img src="../images/swap2.png">

	</ul>
	<p class="secthead"><a name="doc_chap3_sect2">Smart Swap fields  </a></p>
	<ul>
	<p>It is also common that the capture card/software swaps fields back and forth several times. This filter tries to detect if the fields are swapped, and if so swaps them back.
	</p>
	<p>It is usually better to use this one, rather than the SwapFields filter.
	</p>
	</ul>
	<p class="secthead"><a name="doc_chap3_sect3">Keep even field  </a></p>
	<ul>
	<p>This filter will keep even field, i.e. even line numbers.</p>
	<p>It will halve the vertical resolution by 2</p> 
	</ul>
	<p class="secthead"><a name="doc_chap3_sect4">Keep odd field  </a></p>
	<ul>
	<p>Same as above for odd field</p>
	</ul>
	<p class="secthead"><a name="doc_chap3_sect5">Separate Fields  </a></p>
	<ul>
	<p>This filter will split a image in two images, each one receiving one of the field.
	</p>
	<p>So you will double the framerate, double the number of images, and halves vertical resolution.
	</p>
	</ul>
	<p class="secthead"><a name="doc_chap3_sect6">Merge Fields  </a></p>
	<ul>
	<p>Opposite of above filter.
	</p>
	</ul>
