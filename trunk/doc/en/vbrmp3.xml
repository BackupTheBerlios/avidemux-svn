	<body><ul>
		<p> Most of the time, avidemux computes the offset and length of audio by doing size= time * bitrate. That works for all CBR stream.
		</p>
		<p>
		For VBR it does not work as bitrate is not constant.
		</p>

<section>
	<title>Audio time map</title>
	<body><ul>
		<p> To compute the start offset/size, avidemux has to know how the bitrate changes. For that use <c>Audio source->Build vbr time map</c>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Avidemux will then decompress the whole stream one time and build a time map to know how to handle the stream. You will need Mad installed, else it will do nothing.
		</p>
		<p>
		When the time map is built, avidemux will have a conversion table between time and offset, and you will be able to split or save the avi in a VBR way
		</p>
	</ul></body>

	<title>And if i don't ?</title>
	<body><ul>
		<p>  You will end up with a badly desynced (potentially with too short audio) avi. Even if you just load and save it.
		</p>
		<p>  You MUST do it when dealing with VBR mp3. Period. 
		</p>
		<p>  The second audio stream for avi cannot be VBR.
