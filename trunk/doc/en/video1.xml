<title>Image Alteration Filters</title>
<section>
	<title>Crop</title>
	<body>
	<ul>
	<p>This filter crops the video (for example to remove black border). The cropped value left/right/top/bottom must be even.
	</p>
	<p>You can preview the part that will be cropped using the <c>Apply</c> button.
	</p>
	<p>On a clean video (dvd), you can try the <c>Autocrop</c> button. It won't work very well on a noisy source (capture)
	</p>

	<title>Resize / Mplayer resize</title>
	<body>
	<ul>
	<p>The resize filter is a port to YV12 of avisynth resize filter. Mplayer resize is a port of Michael Niedermayer resize filter, which is used in mplayer
	</p>
	<p>Avisynth resize is slightly more accurate, but mplayer resize is 3x faster without any perceptible difference.
	</p>
	<p>The filter dialog config box is the same for both filters :
	</p><p>

	</p>
	<p>You can direcly enter the new width/height and the resize algorithm or use the slider and the menu.
	Three resize methods are proposed :
	<ul>
		<li>Bilinear : Smooth a bit but easier to encode</li>
		<li>Bicubic  : Keep sharpness, harder to encode (for example leads more easily to macroblocking in SVCD)</li>
		<li>Lanczos  : Hard to describe, very sharp.</li>
	</ul>
	Source and destination are important. If you do DVD2Divx for example, source is 4/3 or 16/9 and destination is 1:1. The other way around for Divx2SVCD.
	</p>
	<p>It is important as 4/3 has non square pixel (different for PAL and NTSC) and if you do 1:1 -> 1:1 you will end up with distorted image.
	
	</p>
	
	</ul>

<section>
	<title>Blacken Borders</title>
	<body>
	<ul>
	<p>This filter replaces border(s) of video by pure black. It may be useful to replace dirty border by clean one (VHS capture for example)
	</p>
	</ul>
	</body>
</section>
<section>
	<title>Add Black Borders</title>
	<body>
	<ul>
	<p>This filter *ADDS* black border (the previous one replaces). It is used internally by *VCD res to resize a video to a give size without altering the aspect ratio.
	</p>
	</ul>
	</body>

<section>
	<title>Flip vertical</title>
	<body>
	<ul>
	<p>This filter vertically flips the video. Usefull when using broken video capture card for example.
	</p>
	</ul>
	</body>
</section>
<section>
	<title>Rotate</title>
	<body>
	<ul>
	<p>This filter was written by Tracy (see file for more informations)	</p>
	<p>It rotates the video by 90/180/270 degree. The author uses it with video from its camera in landscape mode.</p>
